Designing and implementing a simplified market data management system involves several components, including data ingestion, processing, storage, and retrieval. Here's a step-by-step guide to design and implement this system in Java:

System Overview
Data Ingestion: Fetch bond market data from investing.com.
Data Processing: Process and format the fetched data.
Data Storage: Save historical time series data to a storage system.
Data Retrieval: Provide functionality to query and retrieve historical data.



Explanation
Interfaces: Define clear contracts for the ingestor, processor, and repository.
Data Ingestion: Fetch raw data from the URL and pass it to the processor.
Data Processing: Convert raw data into a MarketData object.
Data Storage: Store processed data in an in-memory repository.
Main Class: Demonstrate the data ingestion, processing, and retrieval workflow.
