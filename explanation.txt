Designing and implementing a simplified market data management system involves several components, including data ingestion, processing, storage, and retrieval. Here's a step-by-step guide to design and implement this system in Java:

System Overview
Data Ingestion: Fetch bond market data from investing.com.
Data Processing: Process and format the fetched data.
Data Storage: Save historical time series data to a storage system.
Data Retrieval: Provide functionality to query and retrieve historical data.



Explanation
Interfaces: Define clear contracts for the ingestor, processor, and repository.
Data Ingestion: Fetch raw data from the URL and pass it to the processor.
Data Processing: Convert raw data into a MarketData object.
Data Storage: Store processed data in an in-memory repository.
Main Class: Demonstrate the data ingestion, processing, and retrieval workflow.



To add functionality for calculating bond price and Net Present Value (NPV) for a bond, we need to enhance our current system with these financial computations. Let's proceed by defining the necessary interfaces and implementing the required functionality.


Explanation
BondPriceCalculator: Interface and implementation for calculating the bond price based on the present value of future cash flows.
NPVCalculator: Interface and implementation for calculating the Net Present Value of the bond.
Main Class: Demonstrates data ingestion, historical data retrieval, and calculations for bond price and NPV.
